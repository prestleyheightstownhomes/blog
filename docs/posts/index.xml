      <description>The dog waste station has now been installed and is available for use.
The emptying schedule is currently set for Tuesdays and Fridays, although we&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on utilization to adjust as necessary. More details about the trial run can be found at the previous post here and the subsequent location update post here.

      <title>Dog Waste Station Trial Run Location Update</title>

      <description>In response to feedback, the board has agreed to revise the location of the dog waste station for the trial run announced previously. Its new location will be about sixty-five feet further from the mailboxes along the same sidewalk.
The green X represents the previous location. The red X is the new location.
Please also note that the fast-setting concrete mix necessary calls for an ambient temperature of at least 40Â°F for install, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on the weather forecasts for a good day / time to install.</description>

      <description>The board has approved a trial run of a revival of the dog waste station previously installed in the neighborhood. I plan to install it over the next few days in roughly the same place as it was before. Dog waste stations are commonly found in nicer managed communities, so it&amp;rsquo;s our expectation that this is one small step we can take to help bolster the home values for all HOA members.</description>

      <description>I put together a spreadsheet and pie chart to help show how much of our $75 monthly dues go to what expenses for the homeowners&#39; association. The data here is based on our 2021 budget.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the chart:
This basically involved grouping various categories from the budget to make it a little easier to understand. For more details, you can check out the spreadsheet behind the chart here.</description>
