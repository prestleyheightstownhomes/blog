      <title>Suspending effort for township / school district change</title>

      <guid>https://blog.prestleyheightstownhomes.org/posts/suspending-collier-chartiers/</guid>
      <description>Following the review of the report we received last month from the counsel we retained earlier last year, the Board of Directors has agreed to suspend the Homeowners&amp;rsquo; Association efforts to pursue a potential change of township and/or school district. We also recovered $1,572.68 of the $2,500 originally committed toward a retainer with the firm for the project.
The report took longer to come back than we expected and painted a fairly disappointing outlook.</description>

      <description>Today the board approved our budget for the upcoming year. Copies of it will be mailed to all homeowners this week, although you can also see it online here.
Just like last year, I put together a spreadsheet and pie chart to help show how much of our $75 monthly dues go to what expenses for the homeowners&amp;rsquo; association. Here&amp;rsquo;s the chart for 2022:

      <title>Mailbox electricity - November 2021 Update</title>
      <link>https://blog.prestleyheightstownhomes.org/posts/mailbox-electricity-november-update/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.prestleyheightstownhomes.org/posts/mailbox-electricity-november-update/</guid>
      <description>Despite numerous hurdles, we now do have functioning wired electricity behind our mailboxes.
Historically accomplishing this has been much more difficult than one might anticipate due to the lack of availability of nearby suitable hookups for new electric service. It took multiple attempts with multiple contractors, but it was confirmed to me earlier this week that we&amp;rsquo;re officially wired in.

      <title>Sidewalk snow removal - Winter 2021-22</title>

      <description>Yesterday, our board of directors voted to approve moving forward with a contractor for removal of snow from our sidewalks for the upcoming winter season. The removal of snow and ice from the sidewalks has been part of our Declaration and CC&amp;amp;Rs since the association was formed, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done in prior years due to high expected costs.
The service is to include plowing the sidewalks and application of calcium.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s storms are reported to have brought an increase in fall armyworms to our region.

Please report to us any sightings of armyworms or evidence of their activity. There&amp;rsquo;s a picture of one in the article above and they can apparently destroy lawns fairly quickly. We&amp;rsquo;ll continue to monitor the situation.</description>

      <description>Due to the strong rains we&amp;rsquo;ve been receiving and the upcoming week&amp;rsquo;s forecast, the re-sealing (and later striping and parking stop installation) will be rescheduled at a later date.
The cones have been removed and I&amp;rsquo;ll post again when I have the new date. The lot is open for parking until the new date approaches.</description>

      <description>Due to the strong rain we received the afternoon of our parking lot&amp;rsquo;s sealing, the contractor has scheduled us for a re-sealing on this Tuesday, August 17, weather permitting. This will address the areas that look like some of the sealer has washed away.
As a result, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to leave the cones up over the weekend. The line striping and parking block installation will be scheduled afterward.</description>

      <description>Our small parking lot had its asphalt sealed this morning, but due to this afternoon&amp;rsquo;s rain, the striping and parking block installation is being rescheduled. I&amp;rsquo;ll make another post when I have a new date.
Thanks to all who cooperated with getting parked vehicles clear of the area. The contractor tells me it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be driven or parked on for two days, so I&amp;rsquo;ll remove the cones and tape on Friday (August 13).</description>

      <description>The contractor selected by the board of directors for the asphalt sealing of our small parking lot has scheduled the work for Wednesday, August 11, 2021 (weather permitting). The work will also include painting lines and installing parking stops, which should make for a clean, well-maintained look for our parking area.
Pictured above: Our small parking lot.
As a result, we&amp;rsquo;ll need all vehicles to be removed from the area for the work to be completed.</description>

      <description>Just as a quick update on the mailbox electricity project:
The electrician we had contracted with in the spring was unable to get the wires under the road. A part for the tool being used was broken in the process and he had ordered a replacement. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;d been simultaneously waiting for that replacement part to arrive while also seeking potentially a different contractor to help with getting conduit (for wire) under the road.</description>

      <description>Sidewalk repairs The board has approved hiring a contractor (Big Bear Concrete Leveling) for some minor sidewalk repairs. This includes a place near the entrance of the townhomes where a sidewalk segment is no longer level with the ones adjacent to it, and a few segments that have significant cracks / crushing visible.
Work is scheduled to take place this Friday, July 23, and is expected to be completed during the same day.</description>

      <description>Dog waste station upsize In response to feedback received during the annual meeting, the board agreed to upgrade the size of the dog waste station container. The previous size was 10 gallons and the bigger size (now installed) is 22 gallons. The ongoing costs of emptying were unchanged as a result.
The one on the left is the prior, smaller size. The one on the right is the one currently installed.</description>

      <description>Dear homeowner:
As you may have heard during our annual meeting on April 29th, we are exploring the idea of having our townhomes included as part of Collier Township / Chartiers Valley School District to align with the rest of the Prestley Heights community.
In order to determine the benefits, drawbacks, legal processes, and likelihood of success, the board is planning to retain a law firm for a cost of up to $2,500.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.prestleyheightstownhomes.org/posts/spring-2021-updates/</guid>
      <description>A few quick updates to our homeowners&amp;rsquo; association members:
The mailbox power project is expected to continue late this week or early next week. The bit on the boring tool our electrician was using got burned up in the process, so he&amp;rsquo;s ordered another that&amp;rsquo;s expected to arrive soon.
The conduit along the hillside is buried and the post for the meter and panel is up, so we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful the project will be completed without further delays after the boring is complete.</description>

Need some inspiration?
 Are monthly dues too high? Is rule enforcement too strict? Not strict enough? Any new rules or policies you would like to see? Any existing rules or policies that should be changed or removed? Any projects or improvements you would like to see around the neighborhood? Have a topic you&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss at the next meeting?</description>

      <description>Since convening in December, the board of directors has investigated getting lighting for our shared mailboxes as a top priority. Historically this has been more difficult than expected due to a lack of suitable connection points near the mailboxes for new electric service to be installed. After months of phone calls, appointments, e-mails, and site visits, the board has approved taking the first big step in moving toward this goal.</description>

The meeting is scheduled for Thursday, April 29 2021 at 7pm.
The board of directors has decided to hold the meeting virtually. This should allow for as many association members to comfortably attend as possible.
The meeting ended at 8pm. An audio recording of the meeting is available here.

As a friendly reminder: the lamp posts in front of individual houses are the primary source of light made available to those walking after dark in the neighborhood. Homeowners are responsible for ensuring they remain functional and with working bulbs for the safety and consistency of our community.

      <guid>https://blog.prestleyheightstownhomes.org/posts/hillside-structural-assessments/</guid>
      <description>Last month, the board investigated seeking the opinions of qualified engineers to assess the structural integrity of our hillside. While no imminent issues were expected to be found, it was deemed sufficiently within the interests of the homeowners&amp;rsquo; association to at least pursue the costs and potential recommended remediation steps of any issues found. This has been a minor concern brought up at our last few in-person annual meetings.
I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to report we&amp;rsquo;ve now had two separate firms make on-site visits to assess, and both have acknowledged no significant concerns about the structural integrity of the hillside.</description>

      <description>In response to feedback, the board has agreed to revise the location of the dog waste station for the trial run announced previously. Its new location will be about sixty-five feet further from the mailboxes along the same sidewalk.
The green X represents the previous location. The red X is the new location.
Please also note that the fast-setting concrete mix necessary calls for an ambient temperature of at least 40°F for install, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on the weather forecasts for a good day / time to install.</description>

      <description>The board has approved a trial run of a revival of the dog waste station previously installed in the neighborhood. I plan to install it over the next few days in roughly the same place as it was before. Dog waste stations are commonly found in nicer managed communities, so it&amp;rsquo;s our expectation that this is one small step we can take to help bolster the home values for all HOA members.</description>
