Reminder letters will be sent out shortly to homeowners with lamp posts that have not been lit up at night.

As a friendly reminder: the lamp posts in front of individual houses are the primary source of light made available to those walking after dark in the neighborhood. Homeowners are responsible for ensuring they remain functional and with working bulbs for the safety and consistency of our community.

For those purchasing:

Each post has three sockets for bulbs. The bulbs are commonly referred to as the "candle" style, and are available at major retailers. LED bulbs are typically recommended for lower power consumption and longer life.

Bulbs are often graded by color temperature. 2700K is described as a "warm yellow" kind of light with 5000K being "bright white" or "daylight."
