## Dog waste station upsize

In response to feedback received during the annual meeting, the board agreed to upgrade the size of the dog waste station container. The previous size was 10 gallons and the bigger size (now installed) is 22 gallons. The ongoing costs of emptying were unchanged as a result.

*The one on the left is the prior, smaller size. The one on the right is the one currently installed.*

We'll continue to keep an eye on utilization to adjust as necessary.
