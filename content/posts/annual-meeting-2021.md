Now that spring is upon us, the time for the annual meeting of our homeownersâ€™ association is approaching.

The meeting is scheduled for **Thursday, April 29 2021 at 7pm**.

The board of directors has decided to hold the meeting *virtually*. This should allow for as many association members to comfortably attend as possible.

**The meeting ended at 8pm. An audio recording of the meeting is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/prestley-heights-townhomes/annual-meeting-2021-audio.m4a).**
