Now that spring is upon us, the time for the annual meeting of our homeowners’ association is approaching.

The meeting is scheduled for **Thursday, April 29 2021 at 7pm**.

The board of directors has decided to hold the meeting *virtually*. This should allow for as many association members to comfortably attend as possible.

**The link to join the meeting will be posted here on this web page at 5pm today.**
