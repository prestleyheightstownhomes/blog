Now that spring is upon us, the time for the annual meeting of our homeowners’ association is approaching.

The meeting is scheduled for **Thursday, April 29 2021 at 7pm**.

The board of directors has decided to hold the meeting *virtually*. This should allow for as many association members to comfortably attend as possible.

The agenda and link to join the meeting will be posted **here on this web page.** Please check back later before the meeting.

If you’d like to download the app ahead of time, we’ll be using Zoom. It’s available on their website at [zoom.us](http://zoom.us) and on mobile app stores. Call-in phone numbers will be available, as well.
