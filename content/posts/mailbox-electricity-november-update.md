Despite numerous hurdles, we now do have functioning wired electricity behind our mailboxes. 

Historically accomplishing this has been much more difficult than one might anticipate due to the lack of availability of nearby suitable hookups for new electric service. It took multiple attempts with multiple contractors, but it was confirmed to me earlier this week that we're officially wired in.

The service installed is to support up to 100 amps.

Certainly electricity alone doesn't benefit us much, but this now allows for moving forward with hooking our parking pad lights back up in the short term, and going forward: mailbox lighting and potentially other projects.
