Our small parking lot had its asphalt sealed this morning, but due to this afternoon's rain, the striping and parking block installation is being rescheduled. I'll make another post when I have a new date.

Thanks to all who cooperated with getting parked vehicles clear of the area. The contractor tells me **it shouldn't be driven or parked on for two days, so I'll remove the cones and tape on Friday (August 13)**.
