Following the review of the report we received last month from the counsel we retained earlier last year, the Board of Directors has agreed to suspend the Homeowners' Association efforts to pursue a potential change of township and/or school district. We also recovered $1,572.68 of the $2,500 originally committed toward a retainer with the firm for the project.

The report took longer to come back than we expected and painted a fairly disappointing outlook. Any efforts are likely to take a long time (8-10 years), and very few efforts by other groups have been successful. Legal costs throughout the process would likely be non-trivial and require ongoing additional spending without any guarantee of the efforts making tangible progress. 

Committing to a project like this in a townhome community with many residents only expecting to live here ~5 years is a difficult proposition. The group that succeeded with this most recently (Washington Township) included a lot more residents with a much larger pool from which to fund the efforts, and it still took them nearly a decade with multiple years-long setbacks along the way.

One new recommendation we did receive, though, is that if an effort is to be pursued, it should likely be brought by a group of taxpayers independent of the Homeowners' Association. This would ensure the petitioners have standing, and the HOA might not (since it doesn't pay real estate taxes in and of itself). That may seem like a minor technicality, but as a non-lawyer having read what Washington Township went through, it seems very clear any remotely valid justification for declining / postponing a school district change is likely to be used against us.

That said, this doesn't rule out the effort completely--it just suggests it's probably not within scope of the homeowners' association. As always, feel free to send me a message if you have any thoughts or questions you'd like to share.
