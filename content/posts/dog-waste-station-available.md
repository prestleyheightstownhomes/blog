The dog waste station has now been installed and is available for use.

The emptying schedule is currently set for Tuesdays and Fridays, although we'll be keeping an eye on utilization to adjust as necessary. More details about the trial run can be found at the previous post [here](../dog-waste-station-trial/) and the subsequent location update post [here](../dog-waste-station-trial-location-update/).
