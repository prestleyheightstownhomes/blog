Due to the strong rain we received the afternoon of our parking lot's sealing, the contractor has scheduled us for a re-sealing on **this Tuesday, August 17**, weather permitting. This will address the areas that look like some of the sealer has washed away.

As a result, I'm planning to leave the cones up over the weekend. The line striping and parking block installation will be scheduled afterward.
