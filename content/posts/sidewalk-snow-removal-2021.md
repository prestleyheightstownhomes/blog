Yesterday, our board of directors voted to approve moving forward with a contractor for removal of snow from our sidewalks for the upcoming winter season. The removal of snow and ice from the sidewalks has been part of our Declaration and CC&Rs since the association was formed, but hadn't been done in prior years due to high expected costs.

The service is to include plowing the sidewalks and application of calcium. The cost is billed per-occurrence, and the contractor we've chosen is the same one that already removes the snow from the sidewalk at the bottom of the hill and in front of our mailboxes.

As is typical for November, we'll be approving and sharing our upcoming annual budget in the coming days or weeks. The increased costs of the snow removal fit within our operational budget and will not necessitate an increase in dues.

We'll be keeping a close eye on how well it's going and be re-assessing how / if we'd like to continue pursuing sidewalk snow removal next year in the spring. As always, feel free to [share your feedback](../seeking-feedback/) and let us know what you think.
