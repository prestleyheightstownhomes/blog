Since convening in December, the board of directors has investigated getting lighting for our shared mailboxes as a top priority. Historically this has been more difficult than expected due to a lack of suitable connection points near the mailboxes for new electric service to be installed. After months of phone calls, appointments, e-mails, and site visits, the board has approved taking the first big step in moving toward this goal.

Today we've been given a tentative date for the work to be started: **Tuesday, April 13**. This will cover the first "phase" of the work, which is simply to get *electricity* to the mailbox area. That includes a new electric meter and panel, along with the wiring bored under the road and sidewalks to the mailbox area.

*The Red X denotes the source of new electric service. The blue line represents an approximate path for the new wire, and the green X is the mailbox area.*

With that work completed, the plan is to then collect estimates and hire an electrician to re-connect the long-disconnected lamp posts behind our parking pad. We'll also be straightening them out physically as some have started to lean.

If all goes well, we'll then be in an excellent position to consider options for mailbox lighting.
