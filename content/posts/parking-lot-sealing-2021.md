The contractor selected by the board of directors for the asphalt sealing of our small parking lot has scheduled the work for **Wednesday, August 11, 2021** (weather permitting). The work will also include painting lines and installing parking stops, which should make for a clean, well-maintained look for our parking area.

As a result, we'll need **all vehicles to be removed from the area for the work to be completed.** I'll start roping off the area and knocking on doors early next week to ensure it's cleared out in time for the work to get done.

We appreciate residents' cooperation for this small project. It's expected to be completed in one day.
