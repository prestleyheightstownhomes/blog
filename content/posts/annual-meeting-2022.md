Our annual meeting for the Homeowners' Association is scheduled for **Wednesday April 27, 2022 at 6pm**. We've reserved the Council Chambers in [Carnegie Borough Building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carnegie+Borough+Building/@40.4043179,-80.0944187,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x8834f7d12a7021e5:0x526a5a1b39f80283!4m5!3m4!1s0x8834f7d3b463c99f:0x7a3f05159b2bed96!8m2!3d40.4043179!4d-80.0922247) as has been done in prior years. The room is on the second floor of the building.

Formal notices will be sent through the mail.

The invitation is extended to all residents in our Prestley Heights Townhomes. I'll be creating a meeting agenda, so if there's anything in particular you'd like to discuss, please send me an e-mail ([benn@prestleyheightstownhomes.org](mailto:benn@prestleyheightstownhomes.org)) and I'll make sure it gets added. We'll also have a slot available for open questions and answers.

And as always, certainly feel free to send us any feedback you have [even anonymously, if you prefer](/feedback).
