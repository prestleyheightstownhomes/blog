Last month, the board investigated seeking the opinions of qualified engineers to assess the structural integrity of our hillside. While no imminent issues were expected to be found, it was deemed sufficiently within the interests of the homeowners' association to at least pursue the costs and potential recommended remediation steps of any issues found. This has been a minor concern brought up at our last few in-person annual meetings.

I'm pleased to report we've now had two separate firms make on-site visits to assess, and both have acknowledged no significant concerns about the structural integrity of the hillside. Both experts noted a uniform slope and strong presence of vegetation are healthy, positive indicators.

The firms contacted include [Civil & Engineering Consultants](http://www.cecinc.com) and [KU Resources](https://kuresources.com/).
