Dear homeowner:

As you may have heard during our annual meeting on April 29th, we are exploring the idea of having our townhomes included as part of Collier Township / Chartiers Valley School District to align with the rest of the Prestley Heights community.

In order to determine the benefits, drawbacks, legal processes, and likelihood of success, the board is planning to retain a law firm for a cost of up to $2,500. This legal research should help us get the facts and present them to the community.

For reference, here is how Prestley Heights is divided today:

Once we have learned more, we will send additional communication detailing everything for your review. If we decide to move forward with pursuing this change, it will only be after we gather feedback and have a community vote.

Thanks for your time and we hope to have more information for you all in the future.
