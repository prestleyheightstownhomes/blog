I put together a spreadsheet and pie chart to help show how much of our $75 monthly dues go to what expenses for the homeowners' association. The data here is based on our [2021 budget](../../budget-2021-final.pdf).

Here's the chart:

This basically involved grouping various categories from the budget to make it a little easier to understand. For more details, you can check out the spreadsheet behind the chart [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FITmLLUa6xKJiYZhJMGAa7KGbOtrX8p0BESyXHQ8r4Y/edit?usp=sharing).
