## Sidewalk repairs

The board has approved hiring a contractor (Big Bear Concrete Leveling) for some minor sidewalk repairs. This includes a place near the entrance of the townhomes where a sidewalk segment is no longer level with the ones adjacent to it, and a few segments that have significant cracks / crushing visible.

Work is scheduled to take place **this Friday, July 23**, and is expected to be completed during the same day. We'll be evaluating how well the repairs hold up over time to help inform how similar issues in the future should be addressed.

## Asphalt sealing

We also gathered bids for the asphalt sealing of Sita Court and the townhouses' portion of Sunrise Drive. All three bids were reasonably close to each other, and the average cost estimated for sealcoating the roads was ~$12,000.

Carnegie Borough itself periodically performs crack sealing on the asphalt throughout the borough at no additional cost to us, and I've been told we are on the schedule this summer for the cracks on our road to be filled.

As a result, the board has decided to avoid such a large expenditure for now, although did approve a proposal for sealing the small parking area by the mailbox. This will include painting parking lines and installing parking stops. We don't yet have a scheduled work date, but there will be an update here when there is.
