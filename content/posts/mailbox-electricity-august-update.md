Just as a quick update on the mailbox electricity project:

The electrician we had contracted with in the spring was unable to get the wires under the road. A part for the tool being used was broken in the process and he had ordered a replacement. Since then, we'd been simultaneously waiting for that replacement part to arrive while also seeking potentially a different contractor to help with getting conduit (for wire) under the road.

Having had no success, and after discovering the required part was discontinued with the replacement not being available until November at the earliest, the contract was terminated. 

Other bids were made for the project in the spring and with it only now being August, there's still time for another contractor to potentially complete the project this year.

In the meantime, I've started removing the visible electrical equipment and filling in the exposed trenches. We've discovered that virtually no contractor wants to take over a failed or in-progress project of someone else, so it's important that the area not be visibly encumbered with prior work.

Details haven't yet been ironed out about which contractor will be starting work when, but for now: the project site will have all electrical equipment removed (and conduit buried) and the trenches will be filled in. It'll be up to the new contractor to handle the project from beginning to end.

No money was paid to the contractor that was unable to complete the work.
