Feedback is very important to help ensure we're focusing on the right priorities and goals for the community.

**Need some inspiration?**

 * Are monthly dues too high?
 * Is rule enforcement too strict? Not strict enough?
 * Any new rules or policies you would like to see?
 * Any existing rules or policies that should be changed or removed?
 * Any projects or improvements you would like to see around the neighborhood?
 * Have a topic you'd like to discuss at the next meeting?
 * Interested in an event or get-together that could be organized?
 * Have a way you'd like to contribute to the community?

We want to hear from **you!**

**But how?**

You can always stop and chat with any members of [our board of directors](../../board/) when you see us out and about, but we wanted to add a few more ways for you to let us know what you think.

**Send an e-mail to [feedback@prestleyheightstownhomes.org](mailto:feedback@prestleyheightstownhomes.org)**

Your message will be forwarded to a member of our board of directors. All messages will be read, and though we're all volunteers, we'll do our best to respond when applicable.

**Submit anonymous feedback or suggestion**

You can submit anonymous feedback at our "suggestion ox" here:

 * [https://app.suggestionox.com/r/prestleyheightstownhomes](https://app.suggestionox.com/r/prestleyheightstownhomes)

We won't be able to respond in this case (it's anonymous!), but all messages received will be read.

Let us know what you think!
