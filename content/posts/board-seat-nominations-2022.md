Each year, one or two seats on our board of directors expire and are up for election again. There are five seats total with each being for three year terms. The expirations are staggered by year. This year, there are two seats up for election.

 * **Matt Condio** (elected 2019, expires 2022)
 * Brian Finn (elected 2021, expires 2024)
 * **Max Nogay** (election for seat in 2019, expires 2022)
 * Benn Linger (elected 2021, expires 2024)
 * Robb Williamson (elected 2020, expires 2023)

Emphasized above are the seats available for election this year. 

Matt's preference is for a new neighbor who's interested in becoming more involved with the community to fill the seat for the next term. For Max's seat, he's indicated he'll be happy to continue serving.

Being a member of the board of directors involves mostly reading and responding to e-mails, as well as weighing in on any policy changes or enforcement decisions. We meet in-person about once each quarter at a time convenient to all of us. Overall, the burden is not significant. Likewise, the term is for three years, but if your plans change, it's OK to step down prior to the end of your term.

Per our bylaws and declaration, following a new board of directors being formed, the board will then meet to choose officer positions. Those are all volunteer positions, as well.

If you are interested in running for a seat, please send an e-mail to [boardseats@prestleyheightstownhomes.org](mailto:boardseats@prestleyheightstownhomes.org) with the following information:

 * Your name
 * Your house’s number and street name

If any seats are contested, further details about the voting process will be forthcoming. We’d like to have all nominations received by **Sunday, April 24**.

If you have any questions about being a board member or what that entails, feel free to send me an e-mail at [benn@prestleyheightstownhomes.org](benn@prestleyheightstownhomes.org).
