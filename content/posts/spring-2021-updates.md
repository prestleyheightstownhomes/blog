A few quick updates to our homeowners' association members:

**The [mailbox power project](../mailbox-power-project-scheduled/) is expected to continue late this week or early next week.** The bit on the boring tool our electrician was using got burned up in the process, so he's ordered another that's expected to arrive soon. 

The conduit along the hillside is buried and the post for the meter and panel is up, so we're hopeful the project will be completed without further delays after the boring is complete.

**Our annual spring cleanup is scheduled for next week.** This includes tasks like the edging of plant beds and mulching of areas in the front of units.

**The annual meeting is still on-track for April 29 at 7pm**. All homeowners should have received a notice letter in the mail, but you can also [check the prior post about this](../annual-meeting-2021/) for details.

Don't forget: if you have any feedback on these projects or anything else, please don't hesitate to [send it our way](../seeking-feedback/).
