In response to feedback, the board has agreed to revise the location of the dog waste station for [the trial run](../dog-waste-station-trial/) announced previously. Its new location will be about sixty-five feet further from the mailboxes along the same sidewalk.

*The green X represents the previous location. The red X is the new location.*

Please also note that the fast-setting concrete mix necessary calls for an ambient temperature of at least 40Â°F for install, so I'll be keeping an eye on the weather forecasts for a good day / time to install.
