A neighborhood garage sale organized with the Prestley Heights Manor (single-family homes) homeowners' association is scheduled for **Saturday, June 25 from 9am to 3pm**. Our homeowners' association is contributing financially toward its advertising and all neighborhood residents are welcome to participate.

I'm told another is planned for the August timeframe. Details will be shared when available.
