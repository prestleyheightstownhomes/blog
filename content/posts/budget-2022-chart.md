Today the board approved our budget for the upcoming year. Copies of it will be mailed to all homeowners this week, although you can also see it online [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/prestley-heights-townhomes/budget-2022.pdf).

Just like last year, I put together a spreadsheet and pie chart to help show how much of our $75 monthly dues go to what expenses for the homeowners' association. Here's the chart for 2022:

At a high level, the biggest change is the addition of sidewalk snow removal. This is based on an estimated 13 "snow events," so that could lead to minor dipping into / reinforcing of reserves depending on the amount of snowfall we actually get.

The focus for the budget is on **operational expenses**, which are the day-to-day costs of keeping the organization running and providing the expected services. Most of those costs are fairly well understood, although there may be some variance with landscaping costs as our existing landscaping contract expires at the end of this year and will be up for bidding again. The search and vendor selection typically takes place in January.

**With this budget, we are for the first time roughly budget-neutral for operational expenses.** In prior years, a significant chunk of dues went to bolstering our reserves. Starting with 2022, nearly all incoming revenues are being utilized to provide immediate value to the homeowners contributing them.

The other notable costs we incur are **capital expenses**, which are thought of as "one-time" expenses to pursue some project. This year, that includes things like the project to get electricity to our mailbox area, getting the parking pad light posts wired up, getting the dog waste station installed, and the finishing of our parking spots with lines and parking stops.

Those expenses come out of our reserves, which continue to be in a healthy state. You'll see in the budget we're currently around $87,000, which should be more than enough to cover any unexpected additional costs.

I know this budget stuff can be a little dry and difficult to parse through, so please feel free to e-mail me ([benn@bennlinger.com](mailto:benn@bennlinger.com)) or send me a message on Facebook if you have any questions. And as always, we're happy to accept [any feedback](../seeking-feedback/) you have.
