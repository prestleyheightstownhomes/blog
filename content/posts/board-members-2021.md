Per the announcement made during the annual meeting last week, we have a new member of our board of directors. The list of board members for this term is now:

 * Matt Condio
 * Brian Finn (newly elected)
 * Benn Linger
 * Robb Williamson

The board has not yet met to choose officers / titles.

Brian would like to share the following message:

> Hi!

> As a new HOA board member, I just wanted to introduce myself and share a few thoughts.  My name is Brian Finn.  My wife (Christina Stoltz) and I moved into our townhome shortly after it was completed in October of 2015.  I work for an auto insurance company as a project manager and usually travel a lot for work, but of course not so much lately.  No children at home and no pets – which seems to be a rarity here in Prestley Heights!

> As I begin my term on the board, I just want you all to know that I’m committed to keeping the community a peaceful and pleasant place to live.  I encourage all of you to become more involved in our community, and especially our HOA.  Benn has done an excellent job as our president over the past few years and I’m excited to be working with him and the rest of the board.  Please consider joining us in our efforts!

> Finally, I would just like to leave you with this thought -- a little common courtesy goes a long way when it comes to avoiding conflict within any community.  Please consider what effect your actions (or inaction) may have on your neighbors.

A big "thank you" goes out to Brian for volunteering!
