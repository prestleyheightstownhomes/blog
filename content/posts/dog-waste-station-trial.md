The board has approved a trial run of a revival of the dog waste station previously installed in the neighborhood. **I plan to install it over the next few days in roughly the same place as it was before.** Dog waste stations are commonly found in nicer managed communities, so it's our expectation that this is one small step we can take to help bolster the home values for all HOA members.

The prior dog waste station was removed shortly after I moved in around early 2018. It was certainly something Dana and I appreciated when checking out the neighborhood. There were several installed around the apartment complex from which we were renting in Moon Township at the time.

That said, it was removed over concerns it was being abused (potentially by non-HOA members) and an unreasonable burden on the generous homeowner who had been voluntarily emptying it. To address those concerns, **we've negotiated with a contractor to have the container emptied twice per week**. The goal is to give it a few months to see how it goes, which will then give us a chance to re-assess how well it's working around the time of our annual meeting. We'll then gather feedback and decide what to do moving forward.

This initial period will not include the bag dispenser.
